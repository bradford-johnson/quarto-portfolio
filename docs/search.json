    "text": "Some describe it as magic, and others have not used Quarto. I was introduced to Quarto as it was added to RStudio in an update in July 2022. Once I saw Thomas Mock’s talk Quarto for the curious I knew I had to explore Quarto. I would go into detail about the technical aspects of what Quarto does, but why not show what it can do? This very website is built with Quarto, and so is Quarto’s website.\n\n\nI built this site using RStuido as the environment, but if you prefer something like `VS Code` then you can use the Quarto extension. My site’s code lives in it’s own GitHub repository which you can view by clicking the code icon on the right side of the navigation bar…or here. I use GitHub for version control, but also host my site with GitHub Pages. I bought my domain name and it was simple to get it up and running from there.\nWhen I want to do some sprucing up to my site I create a new branch and edit the branch. Once I edit the files and code I will render my site in RStudio and then push the commits. Finally I will do a pull request and merge the branch with my main branch. GitHub Actions will then publish the site, however you do not need to do the branching. A single commit on the main branch will trigger GitHub Actions and update your site automatically. This means you can edit and publish the edits all from the code editor!\n\n\n\nQuarto documents .qmd are the files that you edit, and they have YAML code blocks at the top of the document that let you control different features such as: titles, what the output is, and many other controls. The output control is very special as you can render a file as .html output for webpages and many other formats! Do you need a slideshow? A .pdf report? A book?\nHere is what the YAML looks like for this blog post!\n---\ntitle: \"Why Quarto?\"\ndate: \"3/03/2023\"\ndescription: \"Why I build my website with Quarto...\"\ncategories: \"Quarto\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nhighlight-style: github\n---\nYou can create and run code chunks, this allows you to create reports, KPI dashboards, articles and so much more. I would describe Quarto as a way to share data analytics or knowledge in a meaningful and completely customized way. It is easily integrated into workflows, and you do not even have to know R. You can use Quarto with Python, Julia, Observable or R. Have a team of R users and Python users?

    "text": "Greetings! I’m Bradford, and I’ve got a bit of a data obsession. It all began when I stumbled into the world of R and decided to make it my digital playground. Over time, I’ve added Python and SQL to my toolkit, turning data analysis into a symphony of code and insight.\nBut let’s get real—data isn’t just about numbers; it’s about stories waiting to be told. I love digging into the details, uncovering hidden trends, and presenting them in a way that sparks those ‘aha’ moments we all crave. There’s something magical about turning data into actionable steps toward success.\nWhen I’m not deep in data, you’ll likely find me hiking. It’s in those moments of exploring nature that I find my creativity recharging, bringing a fresh perspective to my analytical pursuits."
