    "section": "",
    "text": "Some describe it as magic, and others have not used Quarto. I was introduced to Quarto as it was added to RStudio in an update in July 2022. Once I saw Thomas Mock‚Äôs talk Quarto for the curious I knew I had to explore Quarto. I would go into detail about the technical aspects of what Quarto does, but why not show what it can do? This very website is built with Quarto, and so is Quarto‚Äôs website.\n\n\nI built this site using RStuido as the environment, but if you prefer something like `VS Code` then you can use the Quarto extension. My site‚Äôs code lives in it‚Äôs own GitHub repository which you can view by clicking the code icon on the right side of the navigation bar‚Ä¶or here. I use GitHub for version control, but also host my site with GitHub Pages. I bought my domain name and it was simple to get it up and running from there.\nWhen I want to do some sprucing up to my site I create a new branch and edit the branch. Once I edit the files and code I will render my site in RStudio and then push the commits. Finally I will do a pull request and merge the branch with my main branch. GitHub Actions will then publish the site, however you do not need to do the branching. A single commit on the main branch will trigger GitHub Actions and update your site automatically. This means you can edit and publish the edits all from the code editor!\n\n\n\nQuarto documents .qmd are the files that you edit, and they have YAML code blocks at the top of the document that let you control different features such as: titles, what the output is, and many other controls. The output control is very special as you can render a file as .html output for webpages and many other formats! Do you need a slideshow? A .pdf report? A book?\nHere is what the YAML looks like for this blog post!\n---\ntitle: \"Why Quarto?\"\ndate: \"3/03/2023\"\ndescription: \"Why I build my website with Quarto...\"\ncategories: \"Quarto\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\nhighlight-style: github\n---\nYou can create and run code chunks, this allows you to create reports, KPI dashboards, articles and so much more. I would describe Quarto as a way to share data analytics or knowledge in a meaningful and completely customized way. It is easily integrated into workflows, and you do not even have to know R. You can use Quarto with Python, Julia, Observable or R. Have a team of R users and Python users? They all can work together with Quarto, and even within the same document‚Ä¶\n\n\n\npaste0(R.Version()[c(\"major\",\"minor\")], collapse = \".\")\n\n[1] \"4.2.2\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport sys\nprint(\"Python version\")\n\nPython version\n\nprint (sys.version)\n\n3.8.16 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Feb  1 2023, 15:53:35) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\n\n\n\n\n\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes( x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width,\n                         shape = Species, color = Species)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you notice in the code chunk the #|‚Äôs? This is how you tell the chunk how to behave, I stopped warnings and messages in that chunk. You can use Quarto as Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown notebooks and render those notebooks to your desired output. Another thing is that you can use a visual editor, all within your development environment, making it that much easier to make some beautiful deliverables or notes for yourself!"

    "title": "Teaching myself R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was first exposed to R in a statistics course in college. Having some previous coding experiences with HTML, CSS, and C++ I was able to pick up R pretty quickly. In this course we only used a couple functions as an aid for our course work. Essentially we manually created vectors, found the standard deviation, conducted T-tests and Chi-squared tests. We never made visuals or really went deeper into R. This class was remote and during COVID-19, so instead of turning in notes or homework physically we emailed in pictures of our handwritten work.\nThis was fine but I did not like drawing box plots manually. I ended up finding a tutorial for making a box plot with R, and I started turning in my drawings by exporting the .png files and emailing them. My professor thought I was an expert data analyst and we would talk data after our class meetings.\nHere is my first visual ever made using R, and it probably took me 30+ minutes to make, troubleshoot and figure it all out:\n\n\n\n\nThe satisfaction of this and praise really got me motivated to keep going. After I got tired of box plots, I wanted to plot crime data on a map. This was a big part of my learning as I was a criminology concentration within sociology, so it was very applicable to what I liked. I found crime data and shape files from the City of Atlanta and that is how I spent my summer in 2021.\nHere is one of the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù versions of the homicide map for Atlanta, GA:\n\n\n\n\nAfter summer I took a break from R during my last semester at Winthrop and picked it back up in December 2021.\nI do not have many visuals from this time saved as I was working on learning the tidyverse and manipulating data. Most of my time was spent watching tutorials and replicating those methods with my own data. I worked on linear regression, t-tests, and learning functions.\nHere is one visual I found from this time:\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to February 2022, I started working at Topgolf, and I worked from 5am-1pm and spent most my time after work using and learning R. I kept trying to find data around me at work to analyze when I got home. I watched days worth of tutorials and kept up the grind. I decided I was very serious about data and in June I enrolled in Thinkful‚Äôs Data Analytics bootcamp.\nMy time at Thinkful was great, I had an awesome mentor and would come home from Topgolf and learned more about using Excel, SQL, Tableau, and finally Python. I did all of this while still working 5am-1pm and once I completed my daily Thinkful lessons I opened up RStudio and continued learning. In July is when I started using GitHub in a more serious way, and I liked to try to contribute R code everyday to continue learning.\nI will not lie, looking back I am surprised I was able to stay quite motivated doing so much everyday. I definitely would feel burnt out here and there but I wanted to improve my craft. My mentor really kept me motivated and in a true learning mindset. Yaron is a data analyst, and my mentor. His background in Python was great for me to learn it from him. I would also send him R scripts and he would send me Python scripts from our projects we were working on. This was a very cool experience and we really motivated each other in the data and learning realms.\nHere‚Äôs one of my R visuals from this time period:\n\n\n\n\nI was getting better and learning more, however with my perfectionist mindset I created a new GitHub account because I missed a daily contribution while on vacation. I have since come to terms with this, as it is not good to force progress with such high work loads, however this was one of my motivation factors at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October of 2022 I was promoted to IT Team Lead at Topgolf, and in the following December I graduated the Thinkful program. From here I began really improving my learning of R, I had a playlist of tutorials on YouTube saved and I continued finding projects to work on. I decided one way to learn and continue was TidyTuesday, which is a weekly social data project where a new dataset is posted every Tuesday, and using the tidyverse framework you clean, wrangle and visualize the data with R. My new years resolution for 2023 is to do every TidyTuesday this year. So far I am on track for this goal and this community is awesome!\nYou can view my TidyTuesday visuals here on my website or on my GitHub here.\nMoving on to now, I have been able to continue learning R working on various projects and visuals. I still watch tutorials and read books related to R but I found reading code to be very helpful in learning. When I see a visual I like, or something I want to know how to do when viewing R visuals on Twitter or LinkedIn I look at the creators code. Often times people share the code on GitHub or if you ask, and this has really helped me progress and learn many different ways to approach visualizing data or wrangling data.\nWhen I see a data visual I like, I save a picture of it in a local folder. I do this as a way to keep track of things that can inspire me or motivate me. I found this as another way to learn or ‚Äúkeep things fresh‚Äù.\nNow my most recent visual:\n\n\n\n\nIt is crazy to see my progress over this time frame, and it is hard to realize in the moment. It really takes looking at my plots over time and seeing the results. This is another thing I found helpful‚Ä¶\nSAVE EVERYTHING. I wish I saved more in the past, but being able to look back at an old script, or old visual can show you your progress but also help you stay motivated."
