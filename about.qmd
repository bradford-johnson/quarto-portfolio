I'm an experienced data analyst who is passionate about solving problems. I started off as a self-taught R developer and have since implemented additional tools like Python and SQL into my analytics workflow. My experience ranges from dashboards and custom visuals to developing ETL pipelines.

I enjoy photography and hiking.
